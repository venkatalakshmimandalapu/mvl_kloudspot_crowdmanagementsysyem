# Assets Folder

## Logo Setup

To add your logo:

1. Copy your logo image file to this folder (`src/assets/`)
2. Name it `logo.png`
3. The logo should be a PNG image file
4. Recommended size: 32x32 pixels or larger (will be scaled to 32x32 in the UI)

The logo will appear in:
- Dashboard sidebar
- Login page header  
- Crowd Entries sidebar

If you don't have a logo file, you can:
- Use any PNG image file
- Create a simple logo using an image editor
- The application will show a broken image icon until the logo file is added
